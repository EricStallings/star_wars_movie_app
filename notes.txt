Notes:

1. This was originally in HOME.EJS: 

    <!-- <h1>This is the template for the home page</h1>
    The following line is Ruby on Rails, but it allows us to pass in variables into our HTML, AND use JS logic!
    <p><%= title %></p>
    <ul>
        <% for (let i = 0; i < movies.length; i++){ %>
        <li><%= movies[i] %></li>
        <% } %>

    </ul> -->

2. In APP.JS: 

> The order of the routes matters! If you were to place your 404 route handler at the very top, then ALL requests would return a 404: Page Not Found status. 

Break for dinner. 
Left off at 33:48 after loading images into the "images" folder.
